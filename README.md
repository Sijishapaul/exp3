aim- to study tuple in python

theory-
A tuple is an ordered collection of elements written using ( ).
Tuples can store multiple data types.
Tuples are immutable, so their elements cannot be changed after creation.
Assigning a value to a tuple element causes a TypeError.
Tuple repetition using * duplicates elements.
A single-element tuple must have a comma: (10,).
Lists are mutable, tuples are not.
Using +=:
Tuple creates a new object (ID changes).
List updates the same object (ID remains same).
Common built-in functions:
max(), min(), len(), sum()
Average = sum / len
Tuple unpacking assigns tuple values to variables in one statement.
Tuples support conditional checks, membership (in), and count() method.
Use tuples when data should remain constant.

conclusion- Tuples are immutable, ordered collections in Python that provide data safety and faster access. They are useful when the data should not be changed and support basic operations like indexing, unpacking, and built-in functions
