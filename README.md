aim- to study tuple in python


Algorithm: Tuple Unpacking and Distinction Check

Start

Create a tuple named result containing Subject, Marks, and Grade

Unpack the tuple into three variables: Subject, Marks, Grade

Display Subject

Display Marks

Display Grade

If Marks (i.e., result[1]) is greater than or equal to 75

Print "Distinction"

Stop

Algorithm: Attendance Count and Absence Check

Start

Create a tuple attendence containing attendance status ('P' for Present, 'A' for Absent)

Count the number of 'P' using attendence.count('P') and print total present days

Count the number of 'A' using attendence.count('A') and print total absent days

If total absent days is greater than or equal to 1

Print "Employee was Absent Atleast once"

Stop

Conclusion: Thus, we successfully studied tuples in Python and performed various operations like indexing, slicing, unpacking, and counting elements. We also understood that tuples are immutable and are useful when data should not be changed.
